ThatÂ´s a small project using, python (DJANGO), HTML and CSS (bootstrap).
This is essentially a sample job application website consisting of three HTML pages.
On the first page, the user selects a job and clicks a button to navigate to the job details page, and finally to the web form.
All the information the user fills out and submits via the form is sent to the database.
There is also an additional URL that allows downloading an .xlsx file containing all the submitted data from the database.
